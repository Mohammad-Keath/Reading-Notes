   6.  I want to know more about how can I make a desktop apps and creating robots.
   7. I am looking forword to learn more about Redux
   8. the learning goals of the TDD lecture is to make a test to make sure your code is working perfectly
- ## Express   .  [<sub>    Reference </sub>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction)
    1. #### Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.

    7. #### What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?
       - the module is a javascript file that you can downloaded from npm library and each one of them has a specific function to help you improve your website

- ## NPM   .  [<sub>    Reference </sub>](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm)
  1. #### What version of npm are you running on your machine?
     - 9.5.1
  3. #### What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?
     - npm install -g jshint

- ## TDD   .  [<sub>    Reference </sub>](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/tdd/)
  1. #### Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.
     -  if you test every feature on your program you will decrease your headach because you will avoid searching for the problem in the whole program
  3. #### What are three expected benefits of testing
     - reduce defect rate, reduce efforts in the final phase of project, and it is showed that the testing will improve the design and quality in some how
  5. #### Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.
     - individual : writing too many tests at once, forgetting to run tests frequently
     - team : partial adoption, poor maintenance of the test suite 
  
- ## CI/CD   .  [<sub>    Reference </sub>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2aNsQKwyOo)
    1. #### What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?
    2. #### What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and Continuous Deployment?
    3. #### Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background
