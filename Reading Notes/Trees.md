  - ### what is Tree?
     - tree is a data structure that is different from all other type because it is not liner
     - it works as a globalreturant that works in differnt countries and each country has more than one branch
  - ### how to build it?
     - you can easily build it by attaching the node with more than one node (usually two)
  - ### what types of trees?
     - we can divide them into 3 types
        1. binary: which the higher number of children of any parent is two
        2. binary search: that is exactly like binary but must be the left values less than the right once, so we can say that is a type of binary tree but not vice versa
        3. the k nary:  which the higher number of children of any parent is more than two
  - ### why we need it?
     - each data structure has it is own properities that the developer must know about it, and he has to know what he will use and how in order to know how to pick
     - in tree for example if you want to seach about a number in a huge amount of numbers it is better to choose the binary seach tree
  - ### what methodes of order that exist in the tree?
     1. Pre-order: root >> left >> right
     2. In-order: left >> root >> right
     3. Post-order: left >> right >> root
  - ### impotant terms about tree
    - Node - A Tree node is a component which may     contain its own values, and references to other nodes
    - Root - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree
    - K - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2.
    - Left - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree
    - Right - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree
    - Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
    - Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not have any children
    - Height - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf
