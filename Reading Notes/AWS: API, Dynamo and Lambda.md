   - ### AWS API Gateway Overview
      1. #### What is Amazon API Gateway?

            - Applications with large amounts of data and strict latency requirements
            - Serverless applications using AWS Lambda
            - Data sets with simple, known access patterns.
   - ### AWS DynamoDB
      1. #### Explain to a non-technical friend how DynamoDB works.
         - It is a secure server that will help you getting database without server and its complications
   - ### Dynamoose
      1. #### What is Dynamoose?

      2. #### What are some key features of Dynamoose?
         - Strict data modeling (validation, required attributes, and more)
         - Ability to transform data before saving or retrieving items
         - DynamoDB Single Table Design Support
         - Easy to use syntax
