    - #### Graph structure
      - Graph: the easiest way to understand it is to compared with tree, it is just like a tree but with no limited bind number and it can be connected other vertex without needing to be under it
    - #### Graph types
        1. Directed: which has an edge with direction
        2. Undirected: which has an edge without direction
        3. Complete: when all vertices are connected to all other vertices.
        4. Connected: all vertices are connected in one shape
        5. Disconnected: where some vertices may not have edges.
        6. Acyclic: directed graph without cycles.
        7. Cyclic: a graph that has cycles.
    - #### Graph Terms
        - Vertex: A vertex, also called a “node”,
        - Edge: An edge is a connection between two nodes
        - Neighbor: The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
        - Degree: The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex
    - #### Graph implementation types
        1. Adjacency Matrix: An Adjacency matrix is represented through a 2-dimensional array.
        2. Adjacency List: collection of linked lists or array that lists all of the other vertices that are connected.
