         - cookie.load('token'):Load the cookie value.
         - cookie.loadAll(): Load all available cookies.
         - cookie.select(/\btest(er|ing|ed|s)?\b/g): Find all the cookies with a name that match the regex.
         - cookie.save(name, value, [options]) : Set a cookie.
         - cookie.remove(name,{path:'/'}): Remove a cookie.

      3. #### Which library would you prefer? Why?
         - I think both of them are almost the same function with same results but I found the cookie simpler and more clear
