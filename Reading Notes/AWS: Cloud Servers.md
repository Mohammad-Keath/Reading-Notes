   - ### AWS EC2
      1. #### What is an EC2 Instance?
         - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) offers the broadest and deepest compute platform, with over 600 instances and choice of the latest processor, storage, networking, operating system, and purchase model to help you best match the needs of your workload.
      2. #### Name 2 use cases for EC2.
         - Run cloud-native and enterprise applications:
           Amazon EC2 delivers secure, reliable, high-performance, and cost-effective compute infrastructure to meet demanding business needs.
         - Train and deploy ML applications:
           Amazon EC2 delivers the broadest choice of compute, networking (up to 400 Gbps), and storage services purpose-built to optimize price performance for ML pojects.
      3. #### Provide 1 reason to use ECS instead of a service such as Heroku, Digital Ocean, or Render.com.
         - beacause it is the first major cloud provider that supports Intel, AMD, and Arm processors, the only cloud with on-demand EC2 Mac instances, and the only cloud with 400 Gbps Ethernet networking
   - ### EC2 For Humans
      1. #### Where can we find EC2 on the AWS Console?
         - on AWS console on the compute section
      2. #### Explain the general difference between T2 Micro and XL.
         - T2 Micro instances is lower cost compared to T2 XL instances. and they offer limited resources and lower performance, their pricing is more budget-friendly.
         - T2 XL instances, with their higher specifications and greater capacity, and high cost.
         
      3. #### Explain a “Compute Cycle” to a non-technical friend.
         - for example if you have to simply do a lot of things like shopping so you will go shop then another in order to find what you want , it will definitly take time and efforts.

         - quick and simple to get started 
         - automatically load balances and manages scale 
         - no addition charge for elastic beanstalk you pay only for the AWS resourses
