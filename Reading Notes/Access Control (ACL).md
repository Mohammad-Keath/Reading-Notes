    ### 5 steps to RBAC
       1. #### What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and why do we care?
          - RBAC is the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role within an organization
       2. #### Describe a Role/Permission heirarchy that you might implement using RBAC.
          - let say that we have a company that has alot of employees, each department emplyoees have his own responsibility, so it is not logical to make them all work the same like adding, removing,updating
       3. #### What approach might you take to implement RBAC?
          - Inventory your systems: to add control access
          -  Analyze your workforce and create roles : group your workforce members into roles
          - Assign people to roles
          - Never make one-off changes : Change the roles as required or add new ones when really necessary.
          - Audit : if you find that role has unnecessary access to a particular system, change the role and adjust the access level for all employees in that role. 


    ### wiki - RBAC
       1. #### If Authentication is “you are who you say you are,” what is Authorization?
          - your rule is what you said is
       2. #### Name three primary rules defined for RBAC.
          - admin,editor,user
       3. #### Describe RBAC to a non-technical friend.
          - its just like the school, you know that the manager has special responsibility like adding new student and teachers ,and teacher can add or delete or change on materials or quezes,and the student can just read the material and do exams,
          so it is not logical to make them all to do the same work,so their work depense on their role
